# Drinks

## Regular Drinks

We'll have soft drinks, iced tea, water, etc.  We'll also have hot apple cider.

## Alcohol

I'll plan to have a couple kinds of beer on hand.  If you like something specific plan to bring it and stick it in the cooler, or let me know ahead of time.  I'll try and grab a couple bottles of wine for any of you wine drinkers out there.

I'll also have "Hot Damn" cinnamon schnapps to go with the apple cider.
