# Activities

## Yard Activities

Activities will mostly be center around the bonfire.  We'll have bocce ball and maybe badminton set up while it's still light out.  We have a big fenced in back-yard that kids can play in.  

## Music

We'll probably have some music going.  If you have a Sonos speaker bring it and we'll connect it to our system.
