## Main Dishes

The main dish will be chili.  I'll make a giant batch of a slightly de-spiced [Boilermaker Chili](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/78299/boilermaker-tailgate-chili/).  It's my favorite recipe.  I'll de-spice it a little bit so people will be able to eat it.  My mom will also make a smaller batch of totally un-spicy chili for anyone who doesn't like almost any spice.  We'll have pasta to go with it (some like it, some hate it).

We'll have hot dogs to cook over the fire with hot dog sticks along with all the trimmings.

## Sides

We'll have most of the usual bases covered.  Chips, snacks, cookies, rice krispie treats, etc.

## Desserts

We'll probably have plenty of desserts, but if you have something you like please bring it along.  Usually people bring some kind of dessert thing that they like and everyone else ends up liking it too.  If you don't know what to bring, don't worry about it and just bring yourself!
